# =============================================================================
# This workflow checks for changes of the docs in the upstream repository and
# creates a pull request if there are any changes.
#
# Note:
#   - If the PR contains only the updated.json file, it will be merged automatically.
#   - If the PR contains other files, it will be merged manually. Due to reviewing
#     the changes for translation. And the merged commit will be tagged and released.
